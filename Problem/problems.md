37) Amazon wants to maximize the storage capacity of its 500,000 square-foot warehouse by prioritizing a specific batch of prime items. The specific prime product batch detailed in the inventory table must be maintained.

So, if the prime product batch specified in the item_category column included 1 laptop and 1 side table, that would be the base batch. We could not add another laptop without also adding a side table; they come all together as a batch set.

After prioritizing the maximum number of prime batches, any remaining square footage will be utilized to stock non-prime batches, which also come in batch sets and cannot be separated into individual items.

Write a query to find the maximum number of prime and non-prime batches that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse based on the following criteria:

Prioritize stocking prime batches
After accommodating prime items, allocate any remaining space to non-prime batches
Output the item_type with prime_eligible first followed by not_prime, along with the maximum number of batches that can be stocked.

Assumptions:

Again, products must be stocked in batches, so we want to find the largest available quantity of prime batches, and then the largest available quantity of non-prime batches

Break ties by listing the ingredients in alphabetical order, starting from the first ingredient, followed by the second and third.

P.S. Be careful with the spacing (or lack of) between each ingredient. Refer to our Example Output.

Notes:

Assumptions:

The first transaction of such payments should not be counted as a repeated payment. This means, if there are two transactions performed by a merchant with the same credit card and for the same amount within 10 minutes, there will only be 1 repeated payment.

As a data analyst, you're asked to correct this swapping error and return the proper pairing of order ID and item.

If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it should remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.

In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs and items.
