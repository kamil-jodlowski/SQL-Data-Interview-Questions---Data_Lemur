1) This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.
In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.


2) Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.
Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.
Assumption:
There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
